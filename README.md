(IMPORTANT!)EXTRA FEATURE



7. Apart	from	the	basic	features	above,	you	should	implement	at	least	one	extra	feature.	
Feel	free	to	include	any	extra	feature	you	can	think	of.	Here	are	two	examples	of	
possible	extra	features:	
a) Users	are	able	to	request	to	connect	with	another	user.	The	other	user	would	then	
need	to	approve	the	request.	
b) Users	are	able	to	“like”	other	users	—	and	users	receive	alerts	or	emails	when	
someone	likes	them.	 [EVERYONE]
